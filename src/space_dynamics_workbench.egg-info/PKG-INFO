# Space Dynamics Workbench

A physics-first workspace for spacecraft dynamics visualizations. The UI only displays and edits state; the physics core owns all state evolution.

Guiding principles
- Physics-first: simulation state is owned by the core, UI only observes and edits.
- Separation of concerns: core has no Qt/pyqtgraph dependencies.
- Deterministic and testable: fixed-step integration, core unit tests.

## Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Run the app
```bash
python -m space_dynamics_workbench.app.main
```

Run tests
```bash
pytest
```

## Adding a new scenario
1) Create a new module in `src/space_dynamics_workbench/core/scenarios/` implementing the Scenario protocol.
2) Register it with the scenario registry.
3) Expose UI defaults (view range) if needed.
4) Load built-in scenarios in the app by importing your module in `core/scenarios/__init__.py`.

## Units and coordinates
- Units are SI by convention (meters, kilograms, seconds).
- 2D vectors are stored as N-D arrays to allow 3D expansion later.
