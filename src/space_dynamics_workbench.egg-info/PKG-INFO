# Space Dynamics Workbench

A physics-first workspace for spacecraft dynamics visualizations. The UI only displays and edits state; the physics core owns all state evolution.

Guiding principles
- Physics-first: simulation state is owned by the core, UI only observes and edits.
- Separation of concerns: core has no Qt/pyqtgraph dependencies.
- Deterministic and testable: fixed-step integration, core unit tests.

## Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Run the app
```bash
python -m space_dynamics_workbench.app.main
```

## Visualizing frames and vectors
- Use the "Reference Frame" dropdown to switch between World (O) and Center of Mass (C).
- Toggle r_OP, r_OC, and r_CP overlays to visualize the textbook vectors.
- In CoM frame, points are rendered relative to C (C is at the origin; O is shown as a marker).

## Interaction controls
- Pan the camera: hold Space and drag with LMB.
- Move a point: hold Ctrl and drag with LMB near a point.

## 3D mode (experimental)
- Optional backend using `pyqtgraph.opengl` (view-only, no 3D dragging yet).
- Install OpenGL extras:
  `pip install -e .[gl]`
- Enable via the "Renderer" dropdown in View Options.
- Use the 3D grid toggles (XY/XZ/YZ) in View Options for spatial reference.
- Click "Frame Scene" in the toolbar to center the camera on the current points.
- Select a rigid-body component row in the Inspector to highlight it in 3D.

## Spacecraft Builder (mesh + mass points)
- Recommended model format: glTF 2.0 (`.gltf`/`.glb`). OBJ/STL are supported as fallbacks.
- Mesh loading is optional; install extras:
  `pip install -e .[mesh]`
- The mesh is visual only. Physics remains driven by rigid-body components (mass points).
- Portability note: meshes under `assets/` are stored as relative paths; external files are stored as absolute paths.

Basic workflow
1) Select a RigidBody in the scene.
2) Open the "Spacecraft Builder" dock and click "Load Model...".
3) Edit mass components in the table to define the physical model.
4) Adjust mesh opacity and show/hide mesh or mass points.
5) Run the simulation as usual.

Run tests
```bash
pytest
```

## Launching via double-click (Windows)
Prerequisites: the `.venv` exists and dependencies are installed (see Setup).

- Double-click `run_app.bat` to launch the app.
- If it reports `.venv` missing, run:
  `py -m venv .venv`
  `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
  `pip install -e .[dev]`
- Optional PowerShell launcher:
  `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\run_app.ps1`

Note: the launcher keeps the console open only when an error occurs, so you can read messages.

## Adding a new scenario
1) Create a new module in `src/space_dynamics_workbench/core/scenarios/` implementing the Scenario protocol.
2) Register it with the scenario registry.
3) Expose UI defaults (view range) if needed.
4) Load built-in scenarios in the app by importing your module in `core/scenarios/__init__.py`.

## Units and coordinates
- Units are SI by convention (meters, kilograms, seconds).
- 2D vectors are stored as N-D arrays to allow 3D expansion later.
